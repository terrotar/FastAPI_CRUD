That's a simple CRUD application using FastAPI, an awsome framework that it's very intuitive
and, as the name says, freaking lightning fast !!!


I followed the link in the description above but I did some changes, like the use of pytest since
the beggining.

Still in development !!! Follow the commits and changes if you want =]

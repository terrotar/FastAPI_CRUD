That's a simple CRUD application using FastAPI, an awsome framework that it's very intuitive
and, as the name says, freaking lightning fast !!!


I followed the link in the description above but I did some changes, like the use of pytest since
the beggining to result in a project with less bugs. It was very challenging create tests since I
don't have much experience doing it, particularly after the creation of db. Although it's been a
rough time, it increased a lot my skills and projects.


Still in development !!! Follow the commits and changes if you want =]
